Denoising of Sphere- and SO(3)-Valued Data by Relaxed Tikhonov Regularization

- each case, i.e. $\mathbb{S}_{d-1}$ for $d \in \{2,3,4,8\}$, is given in a seperate Jupyter-Notebook
- notice, that -- following our work: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10980 -- we consider the $SO(3)$ by the double cover of the $\mathbb{S}_3$
