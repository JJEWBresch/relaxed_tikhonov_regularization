Denoising of Sphere- and SO(3)-Valued Data by Relaxed Tikhonov Regularization

- each case, i.e. $\mathbb{S}_{d-1}$ for $d \in \{2,3,4,8\}$, is given in a seperate Jupyter-Notebook
- notice, that -- following our work: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10980 -- we consider the SO(3) by the double cover of the $\mathbb{S}_3$
- additionally, some new denoising models are given for: $\mathbb{T}_d$ (torus)-valued data as an application of denoising circle-valued data and $\mathbb{H}_d^+$ (hyperbolic)-valued data, with a rather new convex relaxation idea following our work for spheres and the rotation group
